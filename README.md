MATLAB CODE OF KINEMATICS OF SERIAL ROBOTS CARRYING A COMMON LOAD ON A MOBILE PLATFORM 

Depending on the initial parameters, the code can be used for different scenarios

If only the parameters of a single serial robot is present then the code will calculate the joint variables for a single robot carrying a load on a mobile platform

If all mobile platform velocities are chosen as 0 then the joint variables will be calculated as if the robot is stationary

I'm aware the code isn't optimized and could be improved on. So I'm open to suggestions and would be happy if you reach me with your ideas

The kinematic calculations are based on the following article:
