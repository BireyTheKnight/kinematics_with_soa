# kinematics_with_soa
MATLAB code of kinematics of serial robots carrying a common load on a mobile platform 
Depending on the initial parameters the code can be used for different scenarios
If only the parameters of a single serial robot is present then the code will calculate the joint variables for a single robot carrying a load on a mobile platform
If all mobile platform velocities are chosen as 0 then joint variables will be calculated as if the robot is stationary
